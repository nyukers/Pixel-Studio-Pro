Pixel AI Studio - Feature List

This document outlines the full range of features and capabilities of the Pixel AI Studio application.

--- CORE MODES ---

*   Single Image Mode: The main workspace for in-depth editing, retouching, and animation of a single image.
*   Batch Processing Mode: Allows users to apply a single AI prompt to multiple images at once. The application provides a queue, real-time status tracking for each image (pending, processing, completed, error), and the ability to download all successful results.

--- AI-POWERED CAPABILITIES (GEMINI, VEO & IMAGEN MODELS) ---

*   Text-to-Image Generation (Imagen Model):
    -   Create stunning, original images from scratch using detailed text prompts.
    -   Full control over aspect ratio (1:1, 16:9, etc.) and the number of images to generate.
    -   Generated images are immediately available in the editor for further retouching or animation.
*   AI Retouching (Gemini Model): A suite of presets designed to repair and enhance photos.
    -   Damage Repair: Fixes scratches, dust, torn edges, and general damage.
    -   Color Correction: Includes tools for colorizing black-and-white photos and restoring faded colors.
    -   Enhancement: Improves clarity, detail, and sharpness.
    -   Lighting Adjustments: Apply various lighting styles, from dramatic studio light to soft golden hour effects.
*   AI Imagination (Gemini Model): A creative suite to completely transform the style and setting of an image (e.g., transform a portrait into a cyberpunk character, a film noir scene, or a steampunk setting).
*   AI Animation (Veo Model):
    -   Brings still photos to life by generating short 4-5 second video clips.
    -   Includes presets for camera movements (zoom, pan, parallax) and environmental effects (falling snow, rippling water, flickering fire).
    -   Full Aspect Ratio Control with a visual crop preview to show how the source image will be framed.
*   AI Inpainting/Masking (Gemini Model): A "Mask" tool allows users to paint over any part of an image. The AI then intelligently fills the selected area based on a text prompt, seamlessly blending the result.
*   AI Analysis & Smart Suggestions (Gemini Model): A "magic wand" feature that analyzes the loaded image and provides a text description along with a list of suggested preset prompts for improvement. Suggested presets are highlighted in the UI for easy access.

--- ADVANCED FEATURES & AUTOMATION ---

*   Actions (Macros): A powerful workflow automation tool.
    -   Users can create, save, and run a custom sequence of preset prompts.
    -   This allows for one-click execution of complex, multi-step tasks (e.g., a single "Action" could run "Fix Damage," then "Colorize," then "Enhance Clarity").
*   Custom Prompts:
    -   Users can write their own text prompts for maximum creative control.
    -   Custom prompts can be saved for quick reuse.
*   External Prompt Loading: Load a custom library of presets from a public URL (pointing to a CSV or TXT file). This enables users to create and share extensive, personalized prompt collections.
*   System Instruction: A global setting that allows users to define a consistent personality or set of guiding principles for the AI across all tasks.

--- MANUAL EDITING SUITE ---

*   Non-Destructive Editor: A full manual editing mode with its own undo/redo history.
    -   Transform Tools: Rotate (90-degree increments), flip horizontally, and straighten with a fine-control slider.
    -   Crop Tool: A free-form cropping tool to reframe the image.
    -   Artistic Filters: Apply adjustable filters like Sepia, Grayscale, and Vintage.
    -   Pan & Zoom: Full control over the canvas view in both normal and edit modes.

--- USER INTERFACE & EXPERIENCE ---

*   History Panel: Every AI generation or manual edit is saved as a result in the history panel. Users can easily switch between results, use any result as the new source for further editing, or delete unwanted results.
*   Comparison Views:
    -   Slider View: An interactive slider to directly compare the "before" and "after" images.
    -   Side-by-Side View: Displays the original and the processed image next to each other.
*   Robust API Handling: The application intelligently manages API rate limits by implementing a cooldown period. The video generation process includes a resilient retry mechanism with backoff to handle temporary API limits gracefully.
*   Video Frame Export: A one-click feature to extract the final frame of any generated animation and save it as a new high-quality PNG image in the history.
*   Advanced Download Options:
    -   Choose between PNG and JPEG formats.
    -   Adjustable quality for JPEG exports.
    -   Option to embed metadata comments into JPEG files.
    -   A simple 2x client-side upscaling option before download.
*   Welcome & Settings Modals: A clear, informative welcome screen for new users and a centralized modal for managing application settings.
